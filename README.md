# Go Sensu Client

sensu-client is a fork of github.com/bluntelk/go-sensu-client which is, in turn, a fork
of github.com/chrishoffman/go-sensu-client.

Apart from some initial code reorg nothing has been added. And at the moment nothing works.

I like the Sensu architecture but prefer a much lighter Go footprint, especially on the clients.

Who knows? Maybe this will go somewhere...
